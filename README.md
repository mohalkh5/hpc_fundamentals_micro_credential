# HPC fundamentals micro-credential course

Hello and welcome to CU Boulder's **HPC fundamentals micro-credential course**! All presentations given throughout the micro-credential course are stored in this GitHub repository. This micro-credentialed course is for those who will be tackling computing-, memory-, or storage-intensive research problems that exceed the capacity of a laptop or desktop computer. It consists of four half-day modules and is intended to give attendees a hands-on introduction to high-performance computing (“supercomputing”) using CU Boulder’s Research Computing resources. By the end of the workshop participants will be able to:

- Identify community- and CU-specific research computing resources
- Find help/documentation for research computing Access research computing resources
- Use basic Linux to navigate the command line
- Transfer data to/from research computing systems
- Find, download, and apply software on research computing systems
- Schedule jobs on research computing resources including CPUs, GPUs and high-memory platforms
- Monitor your resource usage
- Request research computing resource allocations

Upon successfully completing the associated assignments, learners are issued a digital badge, allowing achievements to be displayed and shared. Just as diplomas serve to recognize degrees, digital badges are artifacts that offer recognition and storytelling about micro-credentials.
